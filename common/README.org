The components of the Incr_dom_widgets library that do not use js_of_ocaml.

This library contains the components of the Incr_dom_widgets library
that do not depend on js_of_ocaml, in order to make them available to
use in pure OCaml code (e.g. web server code) in addition to
js_of_ocaml code. For the moment, this is limited to the CSS module.
